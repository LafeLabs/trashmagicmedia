- [Learn what the Innernette is by clicking this youtube.com link to a skit by Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5BZkaWZAAA)
- [download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and install, 
- go to the directory xampp/htdocs and delete the file index.php
- download [replicator.php](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagicmedia/main/anarchistbookdistro/replicator.php)(right click, "save link as") and save it in the directory xampp/htdocs
- start the xampp server either by searching for the program or manually starting it from the xampp directory on your hard drive. pin to taskbar or make a desktop shortcut
- go to [http://localhost/replicator.php](http://localhost/replicator.php) to replicate the server, click the link to go to the local TRASH MAGIC MEDIA NETWORK
- or navigate there with this link to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)
- create desktop shortcuts to media/ and images/ folders in the xampp/htdocs folder
- create a sub-folder of "media" called "books"
- save the [free copy of Alice in Wonderland from Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt)(right click and save link as) into the new folder
- go look at it with [http://localhost/media.html](http://localhost/media.html), opening the "books" folder to see the .txt file you just downloaded
- find your ip address from your wifi settings(you will need to repeat this on each new wifi network you distribute media on)
- go to [http://localhost/hyperlinkeditor.html](http://localhost/hyperlinkeditor.html) and change the value in the input marked "Server URL(http://[your ip address]/):" to http://[your ip address]/ and hit enter to update it(this also saves the new value). Click back to "home" to get to the main page for the anarchist book distro. 
- add your socials links and links to any other servers you are putting on the network, anyone else you want to support, payment links, or any other link you want to connect to.  links are added by clicking the "copy" button, then moving the new link up and down, and changing values in text inputs to change link text and destination(href).
- click the little asterisk in the upper left corner to edit the page any time   
- go get more books, articles, and music, put them in folders on your drive in the media folder
- create Trash Magic replicators as shown below by putting the trash magic symbol on a piece of trash along with "TRASH MAGIC MEDIA NETWORK" and "anarchist book distro"
- photograph or video the trash and upload it to public-facing social media on the hashtag #trashmagic
 - screen shot the social media showing the image of the trash magic and save it into the folder c:\xampp\tdocs\images
 - screen shot the QR code of the ip address of your server from the main page at [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) and save it in c:\xampp\tdocs\images, then open that file and print it out on a hardcopy to distribute with the trash magic
 - trash magic forms self-replicating hypertext in the physical world, a form of augmented reality.  Put links to social media accounts, hashtags, web pages, places or anything else with sharpie on trash, place trash in public spaces to add layers of information on them, use that to navigate community members to the server with the media.  
 - each replicated server has the link back to this document to replicate the server
 - this system is PUBLIC DOMAIN on a [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) and should be replicated freely and forked in any direction.  We use this license to stand in opposition to copyright in all cases in all forms without exception.  
 - get files of books, articles, zines, songs, videos, or any other file from people in the community and distribute.  Images can be saved to the images folder and viewed with the image viewer from the main page
 - everything can be deleted, copied and ready by anyone at any time.  Back everything up.  Publish nothing you don't want replicated.  This network makes a total disconnect between people and files. There is no file ownership, just folders and files, exchanged based on trust in physical spaces with shared wifi networks and trash magic media out in public.
 - when you have the hang of the system make a tutorial video of replicating it and share it on your media folder on your server as well as on public social media on the hashtag "#trashmagic"
 - build trash magic exchanges to get old laptops, wipe their hard drives completely of all data, install linux on them, install the Apache web server and trash magic as you would on a raspberry pi, and donate them into public spaces as public media servers
 - when you see trash magic in the wild that you have not seen before, record it, post it on hashtag #trashmagic and screen shot the images from social media into the "images" folder on your server, or any other servers you find
 - move media around town on foot, car, bike, wheelchair, bus, train, etc. via thumb drives and small laptops in backpacks, collecting more and more media from the public
 - replicate the system to more and more people who share media directly, both trash and web
