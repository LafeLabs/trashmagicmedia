Replicate the 5 Platonic solids from welded plastic trash.  Replicate the sign of Trash Magic, the trash can with the eight arrows of chaos, with sharpie on cardboard:

That is all there is to the physical scripture of Geometron and Trash Magic.  Geometron is represented by self-replicating geometric constructions from trash, and Trash magic is represented by any symbolic depiction of trash replication which is on trash physical media.  The rest of the media here is all from the existing self-replicating media of humanity: religion/philosophy/spirituality/practice/science/math/language which is outside of the property system, and can replicate freely.
