# Shapes

These shapes are used for constructions based on fundamental symmetries: fourfold, eightfold, threefold, fivefold, and sixfold.  For best results, we cut them out from eight inch neon green acrylic with a laser cutter.

.svg file for use in laser cutter.  Each shape has side of 3 inches, so this is a 6 inch wide file:

These can all also be constructed using the tools of classical geometry(compass and ruler) or a ruler and a protractor.  So they can be made by hand and cut out from cardboard or paper trash if no laser or acrylic is available.
