Trash magic is self-replicating things made from trash.  We use trash to make media which transmits the information needed to copy all the things in Trash Magic, including the media itself.  This all starts with this network, with discarded laptops running the Trash Magic server.

Projects which are part of the system are:

 - free gas network
 - free diesel network
 - free modular mushroom grow network
 - modular compost network
 - modular gardening network
 - trash based read/write memex technology
 - universal fungi biotech
 - cardbard sign network
 - watershed and street networks
 - all the social networks we build
