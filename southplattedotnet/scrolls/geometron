## Symmetries of the Universe

Symmetries are properties of things which remain the same under geometric transformation.  The Universe as we find it displays certain symmetries again and again in both the living and non living world.  Perhaps the most fundamental of these are crystal lattices, where movement in certain directions by certain distances leads to a repeating of patterns.  Perhaps the next most common symmetries we see in Nature are those of certain special rotations: bilateral symmetry, trilateral symmetry, fourfold, fivefold, sixfold, eightfold, tenfold, and twelvefold.  

Each of these special rotational symmetries has certain scales which are built into them.  When we work with squares and octagons, we find the square root of two and two coming up again and again in 45 degree angle constructions.  When we work with hexagons and equilateral triangles, we get scales by the square root of three, three, and two.  And finally anything with fivefold symmetry has the Golden Ratio built into its construction.  

Movement by one unit, just moving from point to point:

Repeated movements can create crystal lattices, like the checkerboard pattern:

A circle is totally symmetric around rotations:

## Geometron: A Universal Language of Geometric Construction

Geometron is a language for creating geometric constructions using these symmetries.  We aim to build the most powerful possible interface between the human mind and the physical world.  To do this we build geometric actions based on the fundamental symmetries of the Universe.  We represent those actions using symbols we construct using that same set of actions.  We describe each of the geometric actions using a human language we understand, with phrases like "draw a unit circle", while also creating symbols which are used in the language to express itself.  

Geometron is constructed independent of any one physical technology to implement it, or any one set of symbols.  It is a means of creating symbolic geometric languages.  The Geometron Hypercube elements which make up the language are an arrangement of geometric actions into cubes.  One cube contains all the actions which are not explicitly symbols, and the other cube represents all the symbols for the actions in the action cube.  Each cube is broken up into a crystal of 8 by 8 by 8 cubes.  Each of those cubes contains a sequence of cube addresses, which are geometric actions.  Thus the Geometron Hypercube is a model for constructing geometric and symbolic languages which we can build up by hand using pencil and paper, and then implement in any computer language relatively quickly.  

A Geometron Glyph is a sequence of these geometric actions which are represented by addresses in the Hypercube.  These glyphs are abstractions which can be expressed as sequences of symbols in any format(a browser, a pen and paper, a printer or plotter) but which can apply to ***any kind of physical construction***.  This might include movements of motors in robotic machines which carry out automation of production, like laser cutters, electron beam writing tools, milling tools or 3d printer heads.  Or it might include lighting up pixels on a screen or deflecting the beam of a cathode ray tube.  

Addresses in the Hypercube all begin with "0" to indicate that they are base 8(digits are all between 0 and 7).  All addresses in the symbol cube have a "1" added.  The Action cube is divided by types of operation into tablets, which are each arrays of 8x8 = 64 actions which can be arranged in a square on a chess board. The planar operations which are used to construct symbols on computers are all in the range from 0300 to 0377(with matching symbols at 01300 to 01377).  The actions in the range from 0200 to 0277(with matching symbols at 01200 to 01277) are all sequences of either planar actions in the 03xy range or other actions in the 02xy range.  Thus we can build up complex structures which call other sub-structures.  This is of critical value for design of technology, as we can create complex systems of systems built up from very simple components in a fractal way.  Addresses in the range from 040 to 0176 correspond to the ASCII codes for the characters which can be printed and have a symbol on standard US keyboards.  Fonts in English are stored as sequences of actions in the range from 01040 to 01176.  The contents of each of the ASCII addresses are actions which are triggered when that key is pressed.  This mapping is what is represented physically in the custom painted Geometron keyboards we build.
