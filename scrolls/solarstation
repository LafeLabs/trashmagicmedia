We need to find people who can get us the right part numbers to buy these with some economy of scale from Alibaba.  We also need dealers who can buy large orders, assemble them into kits, and sell them as kits on some kind of online payment and shipping gateway or brick and mortar sales locations.  Sponsors will buy kits to get delivered to assemblers who put kits together and set them up, and share them with distributors who train stewards in how to operate the stations.  Dealers are for profit ventures.  Assemblers, distributors and stewards can be volunteers or employees of educational institutions, government agencies, non profits or existing corporations(no new non profit or corporation will be founded).    Researchers will find part numbers, get sponsors to buy test sets, make media to document it all, and share that media.  Teachers of Trash Magic will share all this via classes to grow the Trash Magic Media Network.
