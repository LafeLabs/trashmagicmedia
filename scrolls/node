The *teacher* trains the *operator* to build and maintain the node.  Vehicles are used to transport the node from place to place.  *Venues* are physical spaces where a *community* of people pass by and exchange *content*.  Electronic media content is shared on the *web server* over the *wireless network*.  Physical media is shared via the *Physical Media eXchange (PMX)*.  *Sponsors* pay for the time of *teachers*, *operators*, and direct material support of *content creators*.  All nodes are self-replicating: people in each node can other people to hold those roles in the next node, from sponsor to operator to content creator.
