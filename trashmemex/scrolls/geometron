# geometron
 
Geometron is a geometric metalanguage for constructing languages for machine control.  We use Geometron to program the movement of the probe, both to read and to write. 

In write mode, a sequence of actions which includes both moving the electrode(possibly with feedback on the signal to keep z position the same) and changing the electrical behavior is run when the run button is pressed.  

In read mode, a raster scan is performed. again possibly with feedback,
