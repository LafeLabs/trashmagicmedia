# The Trash Memex

## 1. A brief history of Hypermedia

 - Vannevar Bush and the Memex
 - The rise of the Internet: the Bell System, ARPAnet, the World Wide Web, the 90s telecom boom
 - The rise of the consumer Internet: smart phones, ubiquity
 - The Trash Magic Media network, consuming waste stream of consumer internet

## 2. Geometron Printers
  
 - geometron: a geometric language for creating self-replicating geometric constructions from trash
 - shapes, squares and cubes as self-replicating constructions to build technology
 - DVD stage design, specs, photos, part numbers, mounts on 4" Squares
 - Arduino brain and board
 - Controller
 - geometron icon software, printer operation with pen 
 - other actions of icon printer robot: clay, plastic, different kinds of trash, different tools, extruders, tool motions of all kinds
 - using lever action reduction to get smaller motion with the same stepper motors
 - using the fine motion control of the coils  
 - printing with Geometron using existing fab tools: STM, SEM lithography, laser lithography, etc.

## 3. SlimeZistor

 - schematics, cartoons and description of hardware
 - slimezistor as synth tool, tool for digital music recording and playback
 - slimezistor as device physics platform: tunneling, nanodevices, microfabrication, crystal growth tool
 - slimezistor to study water and soil, environmental monitoring, lab on chip, soil probe
 - Integrated slimezistor/geometron printer as write/read system, completing the Memex system

## 4. Self-replicating media
 
 - trash magic: the purpose is to replicate
 - self-replicating events and classes to replicate the elements
 - self-replicating media which replicates the elements
 - elements: icon printers, shapes, clay coins, cardboard signs, hyperlinks, web pages, scrolls, chaos game spaces, hypercubes(cubes and cards, other media in cubes), trash with icons printed on it(bottle caps, cardboard, packaging, scraps of all materials), icons printed on aluminum trash with metal, slimezistors, bags, flags, skeletron, old mac/windows ubuntu trash magic servers, raspberry pi trash magic servers, neopixels, 
 - full stack geometron/ trash magic memex: print circuits which run Geometron actions and control trash electronics
 - funding: sell physical media, get paid to teach classes, research grants to try things and publish them and teach people to copy them, promotion deals with sponsors
 - media and marketing plan(this document, versions of): white paper published on mass media platform(s), powerpoint of this document for academic talks, youtube videos, tiktok videos, videos on local servers, classes, trash magic media servers(old laptops, private laptops, pi, other hardware with future work), trash magic scroll set, drop art which points to media, physical trash magic stations in public and private spaces,
