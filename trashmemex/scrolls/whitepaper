## Background

 - memex
 - liquid microphone
 - brief history of the Internet, the transition from the consumer internet to the trash magic media network, how trash magic media network can distribute technology

## System Architecture

 - philosophy of trash magic as it applies to applied physics research
 - cubes
 - printer robot: x,y,z stages, cubes, controller, brain, sharpie, clay tool, hot iron, electrode, needle
 - slimezistor
 - all the schematics
 - all the code 
 - all the diagrams and photos of the parts of the system

## Geometric programming

 - how geometron works
 - write glyphs: cut, poke, deposit, etch
 - read glyphs
 - self-replicated web information

## Technology roadmap

 - tunnel junctions
 - molecular electronics
 - organic electronics
 - grow mushroom circuits, bacteria, plant circuits
 - hybrid interconnect fabrication for upcycling electronics
 - crystal growth fabrication
 - water monitoring
 - microfluidics and lab-on-chip
 - build collaborations with experts: molecular electronics, crystal growth chemistry, electrochemistry, graphene, nanotubes, fullerenes nanotechnology, mycology, soil and water science
 - digital music record and playback
 - analog music record and playback
 - icon printing as art
 - saving text files and reading them back out
 - building geometron processors
 - the ultimate full stack geometron vision of a trash based memex running on geometron processors with combined organic and trash fabrication
  
## Proposal

 - grant money for applied physics PI time and grad student time
 - grant money for buying arduino and robotics parts, all to be distributed through public maker spaces for maximum replication, all through existing non profits and libraries
 - grant money for free classes to teach people(money pays via existing non profits and libraries)
 - musicians can sell physical media with music on it
 - artists and trash magicians can sell all sorts of physical media made from trash and printed with the trash memex
 - paid sponsorships of self-replicating media from trash
