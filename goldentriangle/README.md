# Replicator 

1. [Learn what the Innernette is by clicking this youtube.com link to a skit by Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5BZkaWZAAA)
1. [download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) home web server to a windows or mac laptop and install, pin it to the taskbar or shortcut it in the desktop so you can find it again
1. Start the XAMPP server
1. Navigate to the folder c:\xampp\htdocs\(or mac equivalent) and delete the file index.php
1. Copy the file [replicator.php](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagicmedia/main/goldentriangle/replicator.php) to c:\xampp\htdocs\
1. Navigate to [http://localhost/replicator.php](http://localhost/replicator.php) in your browser on the same machine to replicate the self-replicating code set(cybermagic), and click on the link after the files copy(this will take a few seconds at least)
1. Find the IP address of your machine by looking at the wifi settings, and looking for a sequence of four numbers separated by periods(there might be other ip addresses with more numbers but we want the one with four numbers)
1. go to [http://localhost/hyperlinkeditor.html](http://localhost/hyperlinkeditor.html) and put the url into the input "http://[your ip address]" and hit enter to update the hyperlink value and the QR code which points to it.  Scan onto your Innernette page from a mobile device which is *on the same wifi network* using the QR code or just go to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/), now you can share your Innernette
1. Watch [Donald in Mathemagic Land on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_ZHsk0-eF0) to learn about the [Golden Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and the [pentagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagram)
1. Either create with a laser cutter on acrylic or print on paper the [array of Golden Triangles created with Geometron](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagicmedia/main/goldentriangle/images/golden-triangle-array.svg) and cut them out so you have lots of Golden Triangles. To get large numbers of triangles, you can order them online from [www.ponoko.com](https://www.ponoko.com) and get the 1/8 inch neon green acrylic.  Be sure to make the black lines cuts and red lines etches in ponoko.  Order several hundred to 1000 triangles(there are 20 triangles to one file shown here) to get the unit cost of triangles down. Distribute the triangles freely along with the other Trash Magic
1. Find cardboard trash and a sharpie
1. Replicate the cardboard replicator shown in this document using the Golden Triangles to get all the fivefold symmetry right.  Resize the triangles as needed for your aesthetic tastes, create a fractal of pentagrams, color them in as you see fit, and make the trash can with the eight arrows of chaos as shown
1. Take a picture of each piece of cardboard art, crop them to just be the cardboard, upload them all to social media somewhere(instagram works, or imgur, or any image board or public message board)
1. Navigate your laptop to whatever social media account has those images and screen shot each one, then save them all to the folder c:\xampp\htdocs\images\ and crop them to be just the cardboard(and not whatever random bits of your laptop screen and social media got captured).
1. See the images on your local Innernette by clicking on the "IMAGES" link from the main page or going to [http://localhost/images.html](http://localhost/images.html), share and enjoy!
1. The cardboard trash art can now become both augmented reality and [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext).  Put links on it to your web pages, hashtags, trash exchange locations, phone numbers, emails, fundraising links, poems, links back to this media or any other self-replicating media you wish to cast into the world([trash magic](https://www.trashrobot.org)). Move cardboard from place to place, adding physical hypertext to physical spaces, activating those spaces into an emergent community based on these shared stories
1. Record a video of a whole install in your own words and share it with the world, showing your own [Innernette](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5BZkaWZAAA), send the video to the steward of this repository who will add a hyperlink to it here
