# flags
 
Flags are created by cutting a square of black cloth 38 inches on a side, then folding the edges and sewing a hem 1 inch in.  Then the hem is cut in several places along the line, approximately every 3 to 6 inches to allow the flags to be tied to things. The Trash Robot Font is used to create letters which are sewn onto the flag.  One side has "TRASH ROBOT" as shown, the other has whatever domain name is being used to point to the local Trash Robot network node.  Letters cycle through the colors of the rainbow, and generally start as squares either 3 or 4 inches on a side.


Flags are used for advertising, branding, and also as a surface on which all the other physical media and technology can be displayed, as a black background which matches the look and feel of the digital layer of the system.
