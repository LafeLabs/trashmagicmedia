# icons
 
Icons can represent anything.  Draw them by hand to represent anything you can fit in a 1.5x1.5 cardboard square.   Make sets of them as a way to replicate things.  We are trying to build an economic system based on media made from trash, which replicate things.  To do this we take things we want to replicate, and break them up into constituent elements, then create an icon which represents each of those elements.  Icons can be printed using the [Trash Robot Icon Printer](scrolls/printers).
