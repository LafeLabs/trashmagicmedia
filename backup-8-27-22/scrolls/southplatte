The South Platte River originates in South Park/Fairplay in Colorado, winds through Denver from South to North, then to the East through Nebraska to join the North Platte and form the Platte in North Platte, Nebraska.  The confluence of the South Platte and Cherry Creek form the heart of Denver.  Golden is based around Clear Creek, which also empties into the South Platte shortly downstream(North) of Denver.

The Trash Magic Network will build free media infrastructure up and down all the waterways of the world(the Watershed Network).  We use sponsor support to get free open Internet connections extended out into wireless mesh networks which go up along waterways via line of sight from one antenna to the next.  Stations are run by volunteers and supported by sponsors, and are used to transmit media locally.  In addition to building mesh networks, we build local web servers which are used to share media with communities formed around all these waterways.  We will build this network from the mightiest oceans down to the most humble foot bridge, culvert, boat launch, embankment or storm drain.  Our network is a combination of physical infrastructure, physical media(signs, cards, posters, flags), digital media, and social links between people.  We are also building a *physical* network along which physical objects of Trash Magic are exchanged. 
 
The South Platte River will be the heart of TRASHCON as well, in 2023.  On the week of April 20, 2023(TRASHCON 1) we are calling all interested parties to converge on the Denver Metro area and exchange media as a decentralized swarm, building out this network in Denver and then expanding it to the rest of the world.  We aim to build free infrastructure which benefits all stake holders along all waterways: individuals, businesses, towns, ecosystems, communities.  Using the Network to transmit media content which captures peoples attention(music, art, culture, news, stories, classified ads, podcasts, and so on) will create enough energy to support the Network via sponsors.
