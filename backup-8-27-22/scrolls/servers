# Web Servers

What devices can be web servers?  All of them!
 
 - Personal computers(billions of units)
 - Raspberry pi
 - Android + IoS mobile + tablet
 - IoT devices and routers

Billions and billions of potential servers, several per human being alive on planet Earth, all in a cycle of consumption that produces a waste stream of server-ready devices.  

Each web server can host thousands or millions of web documents.  We can build a network without the cloud in which there are thousands of publicly-readable documents *for every single human mind on Earth*.  These documents can be shared freely across the world.
