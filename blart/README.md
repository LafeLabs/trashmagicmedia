# Replicator

1. [Learn what the Innernette is by clicking this youtube.com link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5BZkaWZAAA)
1. [download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to a windows or mac laptop and install, pin it to the taskbar or shortcut it in the desktop so you can find it again
1. Start the XAMPP server
1. Navigate to the folder c:\xampp\htdocs\(or mac equivalent) and delete the file index.php
1. Copy the file [replicator.php](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagicmedia/main/blart/replicator.php) to c:\xampp\htdocs\
1. Navigate to [http://localhost/replicator.php](http://localhost/replicator.php) in your browser on the same machine to replicate the self-replicating code set(cybermagic), and click on the link after the files copy(this will take a few seconds at least)
1. Go buy the song "Blart" from [thiiirperson.bandcamp.com/](https://thiiirdperson.bandcamp.com/album/blart-in-looper-kimble-iii) for $4.20(it's officially $3 but pay 4.20 to send signal)
1. Download the .mp3 files(there are four) into the folder c:\xampp\htdocs\media\ on your machine
1. Find the IP address of your machine by looking at the wifi settings, and looking for a sequence of four numbers separated by periods(there might be other ip addresses with more numbers but we want the one with four numbers)
1. go to [http://localhost/hyperlinkeditor.html](http://localhost/hyperlinkeditor.html) and put the url into the input "http://[your ip address]" and hit enter to update the hyperlink value and the QR code which points to it.  Scan onto your Innernette page from a mobile device which is *on the same wifi network* using the QR code or just go to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/), now you can share your Innernette
1. Click on the link to "MEDIA" to see the songs, then click on each one one by one to listen to them.  Listen to the ones with lyrics several times
1. Find cardboard trash and a sharpie
1. There are powerful images of a better world in these words, depict them with the sharpie on the cardboard, listen again and again, visualize, depict.  Solarpunk ethos? Whimsical Mad Max? Chaos praxis.
1. Take a picture of each piece of cardboard art, crop them to just be the cardboard, upload them all to social media somewhere(instagram works, or imgur, or any image board or public message board)
1. Navigate your laptop to whatever social media account has those images and screen shot each one, then save them all to the folder c:\xampp\htdocs\images\ and crop them to be just the cardboard(and not whatever random bits of your laptop screen and social media got captured).
1. See the images on your local Innernette by clicking on the "IMAGES" link from the main page or going to [http://localhost/images.html](http://localhost/images.html), share and enjoy!
1. The cardboard trash art can now become both augmented reality and [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext).  Put links on it to your web pages, hashtags, trash exchange locations, phone numbers, emails, fundraising links, poems, links back to this media or any other self-replicating media you wish to cast into the world([trash magic](https://www.trashrobot.org)). Move cardboard from place to place, adding physical hypertext to physical spaces, activating those spaces into an emergent community based on these shared stories
1. Record a video of a whole install in your own words and share it with the world, showing your own [Innernette](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5BZkaWZAAA), send the video to the steward of this repository who will add a hyperlink to it here
