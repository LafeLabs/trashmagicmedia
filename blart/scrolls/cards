# Trash Magic Cards
 
Trash Magic Cards are used to represent *anything* we might wish to replicate or share.  They are cut from cardboard, out of rectangles 3 inches by 4.5 inches.  One side(the face side) is decorated in similar manner to the [Cubes of the Geometron Hypercube](scrolls/cubes), with geometric fractal patterns based on symmetries, drawn with magic markers and [the Shapes of Action Geometry](scrolls/shapes).  The other side is divided using a magic marker or pen into 6 squares, each 1.5x1.5 inches.  Each square has a [Geometron Icon](scrolls/icons) printed on it.  These can be printed by hand, printed using a Geometron server and a regular printer, or printed with a [Trash Robot Icon Printer](scrolls/printers).

The Face side simply carries the idea of symmetry as a sort of brand for all Geometron-related communication.  The side with the 6 icons is used as a totally general philosophical language, which can be used to represent *any* set of 6 things of *any* kind.  These can be web pages, people, projects, things, documents, concept, places, groups, brands, companies, books, code repositories, languages, organisms, bodies of water, streets, game pieces, technologies, philosophies, systems, types of food, locally available resources, or any other concept we might wish to share.

The squares can be used to create game boards by tiling cards together.   Cards can be placed in public spaces to annotate physical things.  Because icons on cards can point to physical spaces, and cards are left in physical spaces, they form a physical hypertext layer.  Places can link to other places by way of the Cards, building mixed reality media without any digital layers at all, just cardboard, box cutters, and markers.
