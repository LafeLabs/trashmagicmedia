    # [Mobile Station]()

     - 2 raspberry pi's, one set up as mesh network bridge the other as a science and media server
     - 5 volt or 12 volt powered raspberry pi screen
     - power cables from USB to pi's 
     - 12 volt to 5V USB power breakouts which can source at least 2.5 to 3 A
     - rechargeable battery
     - voltage dividers made with precision 10, and 100k resistors to divide down volages into the range of the arduino
     - an arduino mega
     - a zener diode reference to calibrate the UNO ADCs
     - solderless breadboard and jumper kit
     - a vehicle or cart of some kind to carry the station around
     - adafruit I2C temperature and pressure sensor 
     - small solar cell to run open circuit to as a reference for solar power incident, since the main panels will be at lower voltage when they're under load
     - thermisters which we will read out with voltage dividers with the precision resisitors
     - physical media exchange: shelves, cart, bucket, table, blanket, container, stand, counter, bag, backpack used to exchange all forms of physical media
