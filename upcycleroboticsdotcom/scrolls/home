# Upcycle Robotics


We build robots from trash and distribute them.  Sponsors buy parts, materials and tools and pay builders and teachers who build and teach and distribute to operators who build the network, creating servers and using robots to print all sorts of icons.  We teach art, math, crafts, robotics, physics, chemistry, electronics, computer science, network engineering, and whatever other skills are useful to grow the network.
