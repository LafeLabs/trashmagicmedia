 - Controller
 - geometron icon software, printer operation with pen 
 - other actions of icon printer robot: clay, plastic, different kinds of trash, different tools, extruders, tool motions of all kinds
 - using lever action reduction to get smaller motion with the same stepper motors
 - using the fine motion control of the coils  
 - printing with Geometron using existing fab tools: STM, SEM lithography, laser lithography, etc.
