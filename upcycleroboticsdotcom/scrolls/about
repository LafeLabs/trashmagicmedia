# about
 
 Upcycle Robotics is a STEAM education company.  We take donations from [sponsors](scrolls/sponsorship) to share with and teach [content creators](scrolls/creators) how to make [products](scrolls/products), which they can use directly, sell to support themselves, or give to those who can use the products or can sell the products for their own support.  

Upcycle Robotics is founded and owned by Dr. Lafe Spietz, who has over 25 years experience in technology development using applied physics.  Dr. Spietz created Trash Magic, the Trash Robot system, the Geometron Hypercube, the Geometron language for geometric programming of physical matter, the slimeZistor system, and a standard Arduino shield for various art, gaming, robotics and electrical appliance applications, and the Trash Magic Media server(a physical social media platform on old laptops we carry around in backpacks).  All of this is made available on a Public Domain license in various self-replicating Github repositories.
