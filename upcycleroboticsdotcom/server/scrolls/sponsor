After you sponsor a project, either [email lafe@upcyclerobotics.com](mailto:lafe@upcyclerobotics.com) or [join the discord server](https://discord.gg/HwKkdv8929) to talk about logistics of what you're sponsoring.  We can discuss what memes you want to spread and how we'll spread them, how you want to be recognized for the sponsorship of the network replication.

To support TRASH ROBOT(Lafe Spietz) as an author, buy a physical bound book from Lulu Press and distribute it in a public space like a little free library or coffee shop.
