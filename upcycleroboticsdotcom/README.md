 Upcycle Robotics is a STEAM education company.  We take donations from [sponsors](scrolls/sponsorship) to share with and teach [content creators](scrolls/creators) how to make [products](scrolls/products), which they can use directly, sell to support themselves, or give to those who can use the products or can sell the products for their own support.  This is not job training, it is training to directly control self-replicating means of production which can be used to support ones community and ones self.  We train people in all parts of the system, which they can freely replicate and use both to generate revenue, to help people in their community, and to build networks of self-replicating production using trash as an input stream.  

The people we train can replicate this business, raising grant money to train more people who can then replicate it again and again.  There is no property in this system, it all freely replicates by being Public Domain.  All the terminology is therefore free to be used by anyone as well as all educational materials. We are assuming the the value of what we produce will grow as our networks grows, making it possible for us all to support ourselves as the network grows.  As with any social network, the power of the network will scale exponentially as we add more people.  If we add creators who can make all things(food, clean water, sanitation, transport, medicine, medical imaging, HVAC, etc.), we can eventually move the network off of the money system completely.  But in the mean time we can build networks of self-replicating production of consumer goods which support us all materially as we grow and evolve.

Upcycle Robotics is founded and owned by Dr. Lafe Spietz, who has over 25 years experience in technology development using applied physics.  Dr. Spietz created Trash Magic, the Trash Robot system, the Geometron Hypercube, the Geometron language for geometric programming of physical matter, the slimeZistor system, and a standard Arduino shield for various art, gaming, robotics and electrical appliance applications, and the Trash Magic Media server(a physical social media platform on old laptops we carry around in backpacks).  All of this is made available on a Public Domain license in various self-replicating Github repositories.
