<h1>FAQ</h1>

<p>
<em>What is trash magic?</em>  Trash magic is self-replicating art/technology made from trash.  
</p>

<p><em>What does self-replicating mean in this context?</em>You reaplicate it your<em>self</em>.  Technology/art is self-replicating when it contains media telling people both why and how to replicate it.  </p>

<p><em>What is full trash magic?</em>In full trash magic all of our technological needs are provided by the trash magic network.  This includes food, clean water, waste reuse, medicine, media, shelter, and transportation</p>

<p><em>Who owns trash magic?</em>Trash magic is <a hrev = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">Public Domain</a> and is explicitly outside of the global intellectual property regime.  Anyone working with that regime(any license other than Public Domain equivalent) at any level is not doing trash magic. Property inhibits replication and trash magic aims to make replication as easy as possible.</p>

<p><em>What is Geometron?</em>Geometron is a purely geometric language which can be used to control machines. It is an alternative to the idea of the numerical-based languages which control computers today. It is documented in the Book of Geometron, by Trash Robot</p>    

<p><em>What is sloanslake.art?</em>Physically, it is a Raspberry Pi running a a web server, with trash magic running on top of that. </p>

<p><em>What is the purpose of sloanslake.art?</em>The purpose of sloanslake.art is for people to share trash magic in physical spaces around <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Lake_(Colorado)">Sloans Lake</a>, in Denver, Colorado.</p>

<p><em>How do I post my art on sloanslake.art?</em>Email your art to the Operator at operator@sloanslake.art</p>

<p><em>Can I sell my art on this page?</em>Yes! This page has no method of taking payment or orders, but you can post a web page with your contact and payment info and how to connect in physical space to deliver art to customers</p>

<p><em>Can I sell other stuff on this page?</em>Yes. As long as it's local.</p>

<p><em>Can I make a personal home page on this page?</em>Yes. This is just the world wide web but local.</p>

<p><em>How do I replicate this and build my own local trash magic server?</em>There are instructions at <a href = "https://github.com/LafeLabs/trashmagicmedia">github.com/lafelabs/trashmagicmedia</a></p>
