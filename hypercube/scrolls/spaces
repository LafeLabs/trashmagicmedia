# spaces

We spread Trash Magic in the world using the Geometron Hypercube.  As we spread, the physical spaces we inhabit are Trash Magic Spaces.  These are networked, connecting places where we build things, store things, meet and talk, rest, live, work, and distribute things to the public.  They also include public spaces where we leave things as we expand Trash Magic into all spaces in the world.  

The tools we need to build trash spaces are:
 
 - sewing machines
 - laser cutters
 - printer robots
 - electronics tools and work benches
 - storage space
 - high traffic areas where we can interact with the public
 - static installations in public/private spaces like coffee shops and art galleries
 - Geometron servers
 - free hotspots in public spaces
 - free solar/water/wind power stations
