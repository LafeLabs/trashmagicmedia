### Install PI CRUST on Windows or Mac

First, install XAMPP, a free open source web server for all platforms.  [Download from www.apachefriends.org](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).  Click on windows to download, and click through to install everything.

After you download and install it, run it and start Apache.  You should see a control panel like this:

Click on "Explorer" to get access to where the files are.  From the main directory called xamp, you want the sub-directory "htdocs".  Open this, delete the index.php file, and create a new file called replicator.php which you copy and paste the replicator at [php/replicator.txt](php/replicator.txt) into, and save.

Point a web browser on the same computer to [http://localhost/](http://localhost), then click on replicator.php.  This should replicate the whole system into the directory.  When this is done, click the link to go to the main page.
