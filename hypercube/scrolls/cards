# Geometron Card Magic

- [card.html](card.html)

Cards are cut cardboard, 3x4.5 inches.  One side is divided into 6 1.5 inch squares. Each square has an [icon](scrolls/icons) on it, which can be printed with a [trash robot icon printer](scrolls/printers) or a cutout paper icon from [iconpage.html](iconpage.html) or hand printed with a pen or marker or any other art tool.  Icons can represent anything.  People, organizations, ideas, places, media, objects, hyperlinks, game pieces, elements of any human language, pictographs, or any other geometry with meaning.

Cards are carried from one cube to another in the Geometron Hypercube, the set of all [Geometron Cubes](scrolls/cubes) built worldwide.  Using physical cards in conjunction with media we put on both local and global web servers we can point to any information of any kind.  A domain name can point to a web page which can point to a place which can have more physical media pointing to a server which can hold any media in any format of any size.  This represents an extension of the World Wide Web into the physical world, printed on trash.  Passerby bring us cardboard trash and we cut it up into cards, divide the cards, print on them, put them in cubes, and share them with the whole Hypercube. 

Cards can be used to:

 - find people to connect with
 - spread messages, memes, philosophies
 - spread media 
 - replicate things in Trash Magic
 - promote a brand
 - advertise a product or service
 - build game boards in the physical world
 - represent business transactions
 - represent mutual aid 
 - represent philosophical concepts
 - direct to a place(park, corner, bridge, tunnel, shelter, house, business, rest stop, library, community center, makerspace, art gallery, coffee shop, garden, grove, warehouse, ford, dock, swamp, beach, etc.)
 - build a collaborative game board on flat surfaces. This is a form of physical social media entirely built on trash and geometry.
