Trash Magic is self-replicating media made from trash, the purpose of which is to bring about a world where all human needs are met using only trash and things we can grow.

## Trash Magic Basis Set

To begin the process of building full Trash Magic, we must first achieve replication of a basic set of media which replicates as easily as possible.  Once replication is achieved, we can evolve the system with intention toward building the full system. Ultimately we want zero freshly mined materials of any kind and zero required global shipping to build all things.  But initially we use a mix of found and purchased materials, and a mix of off the shelf and custom objects.
