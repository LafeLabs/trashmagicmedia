# chaos
 
Chaos is the game of building a new world overlaid on top of the old world.  We build text documents called Scrolls and generalized memes called Maps which link to one another and can link with physical spaces in the world.  We build Trash Magic and put it out freely in the physical world in public spaces.  In the game of CHAOS we create a world out of this and share it using web resources.  

This game will be more fully developed as players arrive. Without a flow of cubes there is not point in delving too deeply into this system yet.  Start flowing the cubes and we will build the game.
