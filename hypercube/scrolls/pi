### Install on Pi

Raspberry Pi is now impossible to buy.  Find them donated from someone. Most people who have them don't use them or used them once and stopped due to lack of interest/time/need. Ask around!  Someone will be able to donate a Pi, keyboard, mouse, screen, power supply and whatever other random things you need to get set up.

Get a SD card with 8 GB or more storage and a SD card USB reader

Download and install, then use the Raspberry Pi Imager:

[https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)

Turn on the pi click through all the things, put it on the wifi network.

## Install Apache and PHP so that geometron can run

Open a command prompt(black link on menu bar) and type:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y
```

## Install hypercube with this document for self-documentation and replication

```
cd /var/www/html
sudo rm index.html
sudo curl -o replicator.php https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/hypercube/main/php/replicator.txt
cd ..
sudo chmod -R 0777 *
cd html
php replicator.php
sudo chmod -R 0777 *
```

Check the IP address by hovering over the wifi icon, put that into the browser on another machine on the same local wifi network to see and edit the server.  Or open a browser on the pi and point it to [http://localhost](http://localhost)

## Set up to have names for other servers

edit hosts file to have the IP address of the other servers and then the name you want to use, copying the format in the existing file.

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
edit, and use control-x and say "yes" to save changes.

## connect pi to outside internet over router

Look up "set up port forwarding raspberry pi" and follow instructions to log onto your router and forward port 80 to the raspberry pi.  Use [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) to get your global IP address.  Now your home Raspberry pi server will be visible on that IP address.  Take that address and make it a link on the remote raspberry pi terminal as well as a QR code on both.   

edit the /etc/hosts file on the remote pi terminal so that home/ and remote/ point to home pi server either on the local network or on the public network.  So "home" will point to the local IP address on the wifi and "remote" will point to the global IP address of the home raspberry pi server(which everyone can see).
