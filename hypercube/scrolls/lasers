Shopping for a laser 

[this laser!!! under 300 bucks, open bottom, diode laser, cuts thick wood so should be fine for cardboard and acrylic shape fabrication](https://www.ebay.com/itm/175335091124)
 
We must find lasers we can get access to everywhere.  We must find people who can turn cardboard trash into cubes.  All cubes are part of the Hypercube.

We need to find places, call them, go visit them, talk to the people running the spaces, find people who can run the machines, build networks to expand the Hypercube.
