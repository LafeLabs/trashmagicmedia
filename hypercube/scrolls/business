The Trash Robot Business Network makes and sells [cubes](scrolls/cubes).  These cubes are lined on the outside with decorative tiles made from 4 inch squares of cardboard trash and printed with the [Trash Robot Icon Printer](scrolls/printers).  

Cubes can be sold at any price for any purpose.  It is not "currency".  It is not money. Money is an opaque channel, which carries only one thing: a number, the price.  Modern digital money carries no energy or biomass, and has a negative value of both, since quite a bit of the Earth must be burnt to make more of the stuff.  

Cubes carry living matter inside them.  They carry just in their structure the living language of Geometron based on symmetries of the Universe.  And by printing symbols and icons on the outside of the cubes, they can be used to represent information in the most abstract sense.  

Cubes can represent *anything* using the [universal philosophical language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica_universalis) of shapes and icons on the outsides of the cubes.  And we use the cubes as vessels for the living things we grow our new world out of.  These cubes can contain dirt with vegetables, worms, compost, organic technology experiments, or mushroom grows.  

If we sell cubes for money, we build a dual economy, where we are both selling things for money which we pay taxes on, and generating a purely physical organic economy where living earth and geometry and symbols are exchanged without money.  Many of us will not sell cubes, but can still make cubes.  If a market for cubes exists, we can always feed free cubes to people who need money the most, who can distribute the cubes for direct cash donations.  This pushes money directly to the parts of the Network with the greatest need.  Because we have no corporate structure, no central entity ever sees any of this money.  Nor do the cube creators who give them away. As we build up a cube economy to be more and  more powerful, it should be possible for us to live entirely off cubes, simply making cubes and giving them away and not working with money at all.  But in the mean time, major cube influencers will always be able to charge enough of a premium for their cubes that we can sell just a few cubes to support our operations.

We can also buy and sell cubes within the Network to move them around more easily.  For example, we can buy large numbers of raw panels from people with laser cutters who can just run the cutter and sell cuts in huge raw bags without needing a printer.  This is an easy way for a sponsor to spend money to move things along without there being any corporate structure.   Sponsors can buy cubes at a markup from cutters, aiming to have about a dollar a minute wage for the laser cutter operator.  Then these cubes are printed on with an icon printer and then patterned with Geometron shapes, packaged up for movement, and filled with organic material to make it become alive.  
 
Cubes are the living Earth: rocks, dirt, mud, worms, fungus, saplings, sprouts, insects, organic circuits, and decaying trash of the old world.  Cubes decay and as they get soaked with water to the point that they fall apart and get mixed with the dirt, they go into nano compost bins in other less decayed cubes.  A finished product is a cube of soil.  We build better and better soil over time, and build more and more technology into that soil.  We will grow organic circuits into the cubes.  

It starts with pure chaos cubes, we create cubes and carry them around, use them as media, make content with them, share them, use them to spread our domain names.  Then as they decay we create the nano compost worm farms, mixed with organic food waste, and altogether make soil. We can also print in soil with the sharpened stick tool on the printer robot.
