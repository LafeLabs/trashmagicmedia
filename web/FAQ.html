<em>What is trash magic?</em>  Trash magic is self-replicating art/technology made from trash.  
</p>

<p><em>What does self-replicating mean in this context?</em>You reaplicate it your<em>self</em>.  Technology/art is self-replicating when it contains media telling people both why and how to replicate it.  </p>

<p><em>What is full trash magic?</em>In full trash magic all of our technological needs are provided by the trash magic network.  This includes food, clean water, waste reuse, medicine, media, shelter, and transportation</p>

<p><em>Who owns trash magic?</em>Trash magic is <a hrev = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">Public Domain</a> and is explicitly outside of the global intellectual property regime.  Anyone working with that regime(any license other than Public Domain equivalent) at any level is not doing trash magic. Property inhibits replication and trash magic aims to make replication as easy as possible.</p>
